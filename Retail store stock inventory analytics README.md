Retail Store Stock Inventory Analytics

PROJECT TITLE: Retail Store Stock Inventory Analytics

• Retail inventory management is the process of ensuring you carry products that shoppers want, with neither too little nor too much on hand. 
By managing inventory, retailers meet customer demand without running out of stock or carrying excess supply. Inventory management 
is vital for retailers because the practice helps them increase profits.


• They are more likely to have enough inventory to capture every possible sale while avoiding overstock because Too much inventory 
means working capital costs, operational costs, and a complex operation.


• Based on the inventory management analysis we can manage how much inventory is required for selling the product based on which they 
can  calculate the profit & losses.
